# Deliverable 7
In this deliverable you will begin working with either Eagle or Altium to create a schematic for a PCB of the project. You will also be creating the DC Voltage supply for your function generator.


## PCB Schematic (P)
Review the lecture slides for starting points on working with Eagle/Altium. Get familiar with the software this week, and begin the schematic by adding the circuitry your team used to create the Voltmeter and DC Voltage Supply.

## DC Voltage Supply (P)
The DC Voltage supply will need to range from -3.75V to +3.75V a

# Summary

In summary, for this week you need to:

1. **P**: First Draft of Schematic including only DC Voltage and Voltmeter circuitry
2. **P**: DC Voltage Supply
3. Update your User Manual and Technical Documentation with your findings.
