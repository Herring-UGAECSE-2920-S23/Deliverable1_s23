# Deliverable 7
In this deliverable you will begin working with either Eagle or Altium to create a schematic for a PCB of the project. You will also be creating the DC Voltage supply for your function generator.



## Ohmmeter

## Voltmeter (P)
For this Deliverable your team will be required to design a voltmeter that is able to measure a power supply. The voltmeter should have a quarter volt resolution and measure from 0 - 3.75 V. Your team will need to build an analog to digital converter (ADC) to achieve this.


# Summary

In summary, for this week you need to:

1. **P**: First Draft of Schematic including only DC Voltage and Voltmeter circuitry
2. **P**: DC Voltage Supply
3. Update your User Manual and Technical Documentation with your findings.
