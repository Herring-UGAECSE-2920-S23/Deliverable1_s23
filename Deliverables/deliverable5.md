# Deliverable 5

CONGRATULATIONS, you've reached the first grade-level checkpoint.  This is the checkpoint to be considered for "C".  Please review what this means on the syllabus and from your instructors.

For deliverable 5, you will be taking on your first checkpoint. Below you will find the resources you may need as well as the description of the deliverable. Refer back to the [README](../README.md) and the project description on ELC for more information. 

# User Interface (D)

Please refer to the project description document on ELC for the complete descripton and requirements for this checkpoint. We will start checking the results in class on *Monday 2/6/23*. Groups who volunteer to go on Monday will be graded with more leniency. Groups that do not pass on Monday will be able to retry at the end of class on Wednesday with no grade penalty. If your team passes on the first try (i.e., 70% or higher), congratulations! You will not be allowed to retry. 

# Summary

In summary, for this week:


1.	You will demonstrate your results in class.
2.	We will check Github for commits and to look over code.  So, name your checkpoint “C” code so it is easily identifiable.
3.	You will a upload a single pdf document which includes: a) a brief summary of roles/responsibilities leading up to this checkpoint, and b) a table/spreadsheet showing the characteristics of your solution for 100, 1000, 5000, and 10,000 Ohms.
