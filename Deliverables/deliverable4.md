# Deliverable 4

## Eagle Assignment (P)
For this assignment, your group will be making ALL necessary corrections to the attached files. This will require the use of EAGLE, so be sure at least one group member has this software downloaded with an Autodesk account connected to your UGA email. Download the free version of the software and login with the student account to access all necessary features to edit. You will need to download both the board and schematic files and make all corrections. There are at least 5, but no more than 10. This is an edited version of the Pi Hat Protection board you soldered. Before submission, be sure to use the design rule check to ensure there are no errors left. Be thorough with this assignment and reupload your corrected files with the names edited to have your group number in this format: GROUPx_GPIO_Hat_v4.0_assignment.brd & GROUPx_GPIO_Hat_v4.0_assignment.sch
We typically ask for one file upload per deliverable, but these will have to be loaded separately for a total of three attachments in this deliverable. Make a list of your corrections in your weekly deliverable report. The files are in the resources folder.



## GPIO Diagram and Power Diagram (P)
This deliverable will be very helpful as you progress through this project and add more parts, use more GPIOs and start to use your raspberry pi to its full potential.

- For the **GPIO Diagram** at minimum teams must create a diagram, chart, table, or some way to indicate: GPIO names on PI, Functional name for project, default state at power up, state used for project, and pull up or pull down (if any).
 
- For the **Power Diagram** at minimum teams must create a diagram, chart, table, or some way to list each device that requires power on the design including the:
          1. Name of the Device
          2. Pins that require power(voltage requirement and current requirement)
          3. Name of source delivering the required power (voltage and current)
          
 Whichever form that you choose to use, it must show each source and each active load with the voltage distribution in detail. This should be included in your documentation.
 We don't expect this to be a final design, of course.  But we provided a kit of parts to you. Each IC/component that requires power should be on your list above.  However, in later documentation, you will need a complete schematic showing your design; therefore, this is a first step towards that objective.
 
 ## NOTE: ALL SUBMISSIONS MUST BE PROFESSIONALLY DONE.  USE A TOOL (Excel, Eagle, PPT, etc...) FOR THIS AND NOT PEN AND PAPER
 
 ## Next Design Steps
 Although this is not a deliverable, this week is a great time to begin brainstorming and documenting ideas of how you all can complete the first letter checkpoint (refer to the [README](../README.md), [Deliverable 5](https://github.com/Herring-UGAECSE-2920-S23/Deliverables_S2023/blob/main/Deliverables/deliverable5.md), and the project description on ELC). Make sure you understand the checkpoint and that your team is prepared and has enough time to complete deliverable 5 (aka your User Interface is working).
 
 

# Summary

In summary, for this week you need to:

1. **P:** Complete the Eagle Assignment and submit a specific list of changes made.
2. **P:** Draw and describe your power/GPIO diagrams
3. CATME survey
4. Update your User Manual and Technical Documentation with your findings.

When all deliverables are finished, use the template to submit to ELC before the deadline. THERE SHOULD BE ONLY 1 SUBMISSION PER GROUP. The EAGLE files for the PCB correction assignment can be uploaded separately.
