# Deliverable 4
For deliverable 4, you will be programming your audio car's motors to be used at the same rate of speed using a transfer function. **Hint:** It may be a good idea to check out speed control for GPIOs. In addition you will also be illustration and describing your power diagram and GPIOS.

## Eagle Assignment (P)
For this deliverable, your group will need to download both the schematic and board file of the Pi Hat in order to answer questions about the board and correct purposeful mistakes. Be sure to follow all PCB rules discussed in lecture

## GPIO Diagram and Power Diagram (P)
This deliverable will be very helpful as you progress through this project and add more parts, use more GPIOs and start to use your raspberry pi to its full potential.

- For the **GPIO Diagram** at minimum teams must create a diagram, chart, table, or some way to indicate: GPIO names on PI, Functional name for project default start at power up, state used for project, pull up or pull down (if any), and switch needed to set GPIO.
 
- For the **Power Diagram** at minimum teams must create a diagram, chart, table, or some way to list each device that requires power on the design including the:
          1. Name of the Device
          2. Pins that require power(voltage requirement and current requirement)
          3. Name of source delivering the required power (voltage and current)
          
 Along with the listing is a diagram (drawing) showing each source and each load with the voltage distribution drawn. This should be included in your documentation.
 
 
 
 ## Next Design Steps
 Although this is not a deliverable this week is a great time to begin brainstorming and documenting ideas of how you all can complete the first check point refer to the [README](../README.md) and make sure you understand the checkpoint and that your team is prepared and has enough time to complete deliverable 5 aka User Interface Working.
 
 

# Summary

In summary, for this week you need to:

1. **P:** Complete the Eagle Assignment
2. **P:** Draw and describe your power diagram and program GPIOs

3. Update your User Manual and Technical Documentation with your findings.
