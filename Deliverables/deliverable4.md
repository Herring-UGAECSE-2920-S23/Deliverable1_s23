# Deliverable 4

## Eagle Assignment (P)
For this deliverable, your group will need to download both the schematic and board file of the Pi Hat in order to answer questions about the board and correct purposeful mistakes. Be sure to follow all PCB rules discussed in lecture. Explore Eagle and be able to use this tool (or another, such as Multisim) to model your circuitry. 

## GPIO Diagram and Power Diagram (P)
This deliverable will be very helpful as you progress through this project and add more parts, use more GPIOs and start to use your raspberry pi to its full potential.

- For the **GPIO Diagram** at minimum teams must create a diagram, chart, table, or some way to indicate: GPIO names on PI, Functional name for project, default start at power up, state used for project, pull up or pull down (if any), and switch needed to set GPIO.
 
- For the **Power Diagram** at minimum teams must create a diagram, chart, table, or some way to list each device that requires power on the design including the:
          1. Name of the Device
          2. Pins that require power(voltage requirement and current requirement)
          3. Name of source delivering the required power (voltage and current)
          
 Along with the listing is a diagram (drawing) showing each source and each load with the voltage distribution drawn. This should be included in your documentation.
 We don't expect this to be a final design, of course.  But we provided a kit of parts to you. Each IC/component that requires power should be on your list above.
 
 ## NOTE: ALL DIAGRAMS MUST BE PROFESSIONALLY DONE.  USE A TOOL FOR THIS AND NOT PEN AND PAPER
 
 ## Next Design Steps
 Although this is not a deliverable, this week is a great time to begin brainstorming and documenting ideas of how you all can complete the first letter checkpoint (refer to the [README](../README.md), [Deliverable 5](https://github.com/Herring-UGAECSE-2920-S23/Deliverables_S2023/blob/main/Deliverables/deliverable5.md), and the project description on ELC). Make sure you understand the checkpoint and that your team is prepared and has enough time to complete deliverable 5 (aka your User Interface is working).
 
 

# Summary

In summary, for this week you need to:

1. **P:** Complete the Eagle Assignment
2. **P:** Draw and describe your power diagram and program GPIOs
3. Remember that is a CATME survey coming soon; be sure to look out for an email.

Update your User Manual and Technical Documentation with your findings.
