# Deliverable 1
 For the first deliverable your group will be doing three things: completing your CATME form, setting up a Github account and submitting your username, and doing a "Hello World" exercise with Python/Github once you've been assigned a group.
 
## CATME Submission
Please fill out and submit the CATME form sent to your email! Do this by 1/11/2023, otherwise we will assign you to a group at our discretion!

## Syllabus Quiz
Please Complete the Syllabus Quiz found on ELC by the due date on ELC.

## Get Access to Fab Lab
Complete Fab Access class on ELC

## Github Account Setup

Before we assign you to a group on the class Github organization, we'll need you to create a Github account (free) and submit your username or github email so that we can invite you. If you already have an account you don't need to make a new one, just submit it to the ELC assignment. Otherwise, Github account setup is fairly straight forward, simply go to [Github](https://github.com/login) and follow the instructions there!

Once you've done that, go to ELC and submit your username/email in text to the 'Github Username Submission' assignment.

Do this as soon as you can, so that you can start on the next section!
