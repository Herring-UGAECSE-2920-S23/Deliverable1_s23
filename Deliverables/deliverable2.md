# Deliverable 2

For this week, after completing a syllabus quiz, you'll be creating a team attendance sheet, documenting the state of existing hardware you have recieved, characterizing the digital potentiometers, and going through the preliminary setup for the Raspberry Pi hardware. 

Right now would also be a good time to read through the rules for the project outlined [in the README](../README.md) for this repository.
 

## Solder Raspberry Pi Hat (P)

In order to prevent shorting out the Rapsberry Pi, we have designed a Pi Hat to attach to the top of the Pi. You will need to solder the PCB (printed circuit board) and verify its functionality. This is very important to complete before using GPIO pins. Be sure the diodes are facing in the correct direction to match the silkscreen. This will take a good chunk of time, so be sure to plan ahead.  A helpful hint is to leave the two 2x20 pin headers for last.  Also, make sure that you see that the female header is facing down on the underside of the PPH.  Verify your soldering job by checking for continuity (Does GPIO2 go to GPIO2*, for example).  Check to make sure there are no shorts on unwanted pins (GPIO to GPIO, GND, 3.3V, 5V).  You can use the contiunity checker on a multimeter The schematic will be helpful.

## Raspberry Pi Setup (P)

Finally, you'll need to go through the Raspberry Pi setup documentation found [here](setup/pi_setup.md). It will guide you through setting up the Pi and getting all of the Python dependencies and environment set up. It will also link to helpful documentation for how to work on the Raspberry Pi, remotely or otherwise.

## Practice Committing Changes(P)

After your Raspberry Pi is fully setup along with your github account. You can now use git to save changes on the pi to github or save changes on github to the pi. This is very useful when coding in groups. 

## Create User Manual and Technical Document 

An important part of your team's grade in this course relies on the user manual and technical documentation that will be submitted at the end of the semester. Begin taking photos and recording what your team does each week to ensure your work is organized. This will not be graded on a weekly basis, BUT it is incredibly helpful to have your explanations and work in one place, rather than scrambling at the last minute to remember the details of what was done each week.

# Summary

In summary, for this week you need to:

1. Make sure you have acquired all of the hardware for your team.

2. **P**: Solder Raspberry Pi Hat

3. **P**: Go though the Raspberry Pi setup, and acquaint yourself with working on the Pi/Github/etc.

4. **P**:  Practice Commiting Changes, make sure they are showing up on your repository 

5. Update your User Manual and Technical Documentation with your findings.
