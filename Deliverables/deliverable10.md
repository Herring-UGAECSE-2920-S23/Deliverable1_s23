## Deliverable 10

## Sine Wave Models (P)
Identify two different ways to create a sine wave and determine which would be best for your project. Then, model your choice in Multisim.

## PCB Ready to Order (P)
Your team will need to place and route your PCB with circuitry through checkpoint B this week. It must be ready to order, in order to have enough time to receive and solder these boards in time. Be sure to use through-hole components only.

# Summary

In summary, for this week you need to:

1. **P**: 2 Sine Wave Models
2. **P**: PCB Placement and Routing finalized and cleared to order
3. Update your User Manual and Technical Documentation with your findings.
