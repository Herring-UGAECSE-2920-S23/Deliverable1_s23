## Deliverable 10

## Sine Wave Models (P)
It is time to start thinking about Checkpoint A- items. Identify two different ways to create a sine wave and determine which would be best for your project. Then, model your choice in Multisim. You should have two designs on Multisim and explain your decision for choosing the best to proceed forward with. The sine wave will be 50% duty cycle, variable frequency, and variable amplitude.  You will be choosing your best design for implementation for deliverable 11.
Frequency: 1K-10KHz with 100Hz resolution
Amplitude: 0-5V (positive only) with 1/4 volt resolution.

## PCB Ready to Order (P)
Your team will need to place and route your PCB with circuitry through checkpoint B this week. It must be complete enough to place an order (in theory). Of course, if your team wants to order boards, it is up to you. 
All Design Rule Checks (DRC) in the software must pass. Please use JLCPCB design rules for you respective number of layers ([2-LayerDRC](https://github.com/Herring-UGAECSE-2920-S23/Deliverables_S2023/blob/main/Resources/jlcpcb2layer.dru) or [4-LayerDRC](https://github.com/Herring-UGAECSE-2920-S23/Deliverables_S2023/blob/main/Resources/jlcpcb4layer.dru)). Justify this number of layers and elaborate on any other interest aspects of your design in you documentation.

***If your team desires, Sophie and Matthew can give you feedback on your design prior to the final submission. Email both of us to schedule a time.

# Summary

In summary, for this week you need to:

1. **P**: 2 Sine Wave Models
2. **P**: PCB Placement and Routing finalized and cleared to order
3. Update your User Manual and Technical Documentation with your findings.
