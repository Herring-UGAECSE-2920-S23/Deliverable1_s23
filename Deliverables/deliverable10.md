## Deliverable 10

## Sine Wave Models (P)
It is time to start thinking about Checkpoint A- items. Identify two different ways to create a sine wave and determine which would be best for your project. Then, model your choice in Multisim.  The sine wave will be 50% duty cycle, variable frequency, and variable amplitude.  You will be choosing your best design for implementation for deliverable 11.
Frequency: 1K-10KHz with 100Hz resolution
Amplitude: 0-5V (positive only) with 1/4 volt resolution.

## PCB Ready to Order (D)
Your team will need to place and route your PCB with circuitry through checkpoint B this week. It must be complete enough to place an order (in theory). Of course, if your team wants to order boards, it is up to you. 
All DRC checks in Eagle.
All DRC checks pass in PCB fab tool.

# Summary

In summary, for this week you need to:

1. **P**: 2 Sine Wave Models
2. **D**: PCB Placement and Routing finalized and cleared to order
3. Update your User Manual and Technical Documentation with your findings.
