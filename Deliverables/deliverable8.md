## Deliverable 8
For this deliverable your group will show progress for the square wave generator.

## Square Wave Model (P)
Using the PI, generate a square wave with adjustable amplitude within the range of +/- 5Volts.  The frequency should also be adjustable from 100Hz-10KHz.  The square wave should be centered at 0V for the Y-axis (No DC offset).  Use your PWM knob and LCD UI to control the amplitude and the frequency (See project doc).  As usual, you must have a schematic and simulation for your design in stand-alone form.
- Eagle Schematic of stand-alone (pdf)
- Simulation from Multisim (photo)
- Stand-alone result with lab function generator as input (this will only test your amplitude gain part of your circuit).  Photo
- Now using your gain circuit add your RP4 and UI wizardry to complete the (P) deliverable.  Photo of PI generating square waves (show LCD output and oscilloscope shot): Amplitude: +/- 2V, and 4V.  Frequency: 100Hz, 5000Hz, 10Khz.  (This is 6 total points)
- You should have commented code on Github.

**If your negative reference is not working, you may use a lab power supply.**


# Summary

In summary, for this week you need to:

1. Make progress on your square wave design
2. Include the items described above
3. Update your User Manual and Technical Documentation with your findings.
