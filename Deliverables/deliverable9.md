## Deliverable 9
This deliverable contains the second checkpoint, which is the x-axis centered square wave. Your team also will need to have a completed PCB schematic of all circuitry up to this deliverable, _including the square wave._

## Square Wave (D)
The square wave needs to be centered at the x-axis, have an amplitude of -5V to +5V, and have a variable frequency controlled by the knobs on your UI.

## PCB Schematic (D)
Your team will need to updaate the schematic from deliverable 7 with all new circuitry added from the ohmmeter and square wave.

# DC Voltage Supply (P)
The DC Voltage supply will need to range from -3.75V to +3.75V.

# Summary

In summary, for this week you need to:

1. **D**: Square wave complete
2. **D**: PCB through Checkpoint B complete
3. Update your User Manual and Technical Documentation with your findings.
