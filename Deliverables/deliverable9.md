## Deliverable 9 (A.K.A. Checkpoint "B")
**We are adding a team document ("team dynamic operating agreement") to Checkpoint "B".  Please review the group dynamics slides on ELC. Pay attention to slides 13-16.  At a minimum, you should include a document that describes: 1)What, Who, When, 2) How are decisions made, and 3) Key roles and responsibilities**

Please follow the requirements for Checkpoint "B" found in the project requirements document on ELC.

As a reminder, there is a grade for the checkpoint which is independent from passing the checkpoint.  You have multiple opportunities to pass the checkpoint.  You only have one opportunity for maximizing your grade for the checkpoint.
