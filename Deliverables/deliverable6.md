# Deliverable 6
For deliverable 6, you will begin moving forward from your first checkpoint into the function generator.  As always, your weekly team status is required.

## PCB Schematic (P)
Review the lecture slides for starting points on working with Eagle/Altium. Start getting familiar with the software this week, and begin the circuit schematic by adding the circuitry your team used to create the Negative Voltage and ADC.
- PDF output of schematics for ADC and Negative Voltage.  These are two separate files.
- We don't expect these to be complete/finished designs.  This is a (P) checkpoint.  Whatever you have for the Negative Voltage Simulation and ADC for this checkpoint should be represented by a schematic (not layout).

## Negative Voltage Simulation (P)
In order to power many of the active components in your design (Opamps, for example), you will need a negative voltage.  For this deliverable, provide a schematic (digitally drawn in your chosen PCB software) AND a simulation of your design from multisim, LTSpice, Simulink, Altium, etc.  Assume the DC voltage input that is available to you is from the +12V DC supply (we will not provide the +12V supply until you show a working Negative voltage reference); therefore, you will need to show a **stand-alone** circuit working with your +12V DC source coming from a lab power supply. Your V+ and V- reference point should be around +/- 6 volts. 
It is often a good idea to try more than one solution.  You do not need more than one solution on this checkpoint, but we encourage you to examine multiple paths for this objective (remember the einstellung effect).

These do not need to be completely working.  You should be showing good progress.

- Multisim output (photo of outputs in progress pdf and simulation file uploaded separately)


## ADC (P)
The ADC is integral to this design.  For this deliverable provide an ADC design of at least 4-bits.  You must provide a schematic (not hand drawn) and simulation model.  This is a stand-alone design and does not need to be attached to the PI.

- Multisim output (photo of outputs in progress pdf and simulation file uploaded separately)

>***Note: These deliverables require a both simulation AND a schematic drawn in a PCB design software. This can either be done in 2 separate files, or if you choose, Altium has a built in SPICE simulator, allowing it to be done in one file.***

## Recheck Deliverable 5
If you have not passed the Chekpoint from last week you will have an oppurtunity this week to get it checked off. This will not be for a regrade of that deliverable but rather a confirmaton that you have completed the first checkpoint and can feel more comfortable moving forward. Please bring your project to class if you wish you get the checkpoint rechecked.


# Summary

In summary, for this week you need to:

1. **P**: Negative voltage design simulation (screenshots on deliverable pdf AND simulation files)

2. **P**: 4-bit ADC design (screenshots on deliverable pdf AND simulation files)

3. **P**: PCB Schematic for both negative voltage **AND** 4-bit ADC

4. Update your User Manual and Technical Documentation with your findings.
