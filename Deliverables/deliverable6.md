# Deliverable 6
For deliverable 6, you will begin moving forward from your first checkpoint into the function generator.

## Voltmeter (P)
For this Deliverable your team will be required to design a voltmeter that is able to measure a power supply. The voltmeter should have a quarter volt resolution and measure from 0 - 3.75 V. Your team will need to build an analog to digital converter (ADC) to achieve this.

## Recheck Deliverable 5
If you have not passed the Chekpoint from last week you will have an oppurtunity this week to get it checked off. This will not be for a regrade of that deliverable but rather a confirmaton that you have completed the first checkpoint and can feel more comfortable moving forward. Please bring your car to class if you wish you get the checkpoint rechecked.
