# Deliverable 6
For deliverable 6, you will begin moving forward from your first checkpoint into the function generator.

## Negative Voltage

## PCB Schematic (P)
Review the lecture slides for starting points on working with Eagle/Altium. Get familiar with the software this week, and begin the schematic by adding the circuitry your team used to create the Voltmeter and DC Voltage Supply.


## Recheck Deliverable 5
If you have not passed the Chekpoint from last week you will have an oppurtunity this week to get it checked off. This will not be for a regrade of that deliverable but rather a confirmaton that you have completed the first checkpoint and can feel more comfortable moving forward. Please bring your car to class if you wish you get the checkpoint rechecked.


# Summary

In summary, for this week you need to:

1. **P**: Negative voltage working

2. **P**: Begin PCB Schematic.

3. **P**: If applicable show code revisions and come to class prepared for a recheck of physical drawings.

4. Update your User Manual and Technical Documentation with your findings.
