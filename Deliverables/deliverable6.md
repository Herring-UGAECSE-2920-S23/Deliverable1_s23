# Deliverable 6
For deliverable 6, you will begin moving forward from your first checkpoint into the function generator.  As always, your weekly team status is required.

## Negative Voltage (P)
In order to power many of the active components in your design (Opamps, for example), you will need a negative voltage.  For this deliverable, provide a schematic (not hand drawn) and simulation of your design from multisim or similar.  Your DC voltage available to you is from the +12V DC supply.  However, we will not provide the +12V supply until you show a working Negative voltage reference; therefore, you will need to show a stand-alone circuit working with your +12V DC source coming from a lab power supply. Your + and - reference should be around +/- 5 to 6 volts.
- Schematic (Pdf form)
- Multisim output (photo of outputs)
- Photo of + and - voltages from your stand-alone design

## ADC (P)
The ADC is integral to this design.  For this deliverable provide an ADC design of at least 4-bits.  You must provide a schematic (not hand drawn) and simulation model.  This is a stand-alone design and does not need to be attached to the PI.

- Multisim output (photo)

## PCB Schematic (P)
Review the lecture slides for starting points on working with Eagle/Altium. Get familiar with the software this week, and begin the schematic by adding the circuitry your team used to create the Negative Voltage and ADC.
- PDF output of schmatics for ADC and Negative Voltage.  These are two separate files.


## Recheck Deliverable 5
If you have not passed the Chekpoint from last week you will have an oppurtunity this week to get it checked off. This will not be for a regrade of that deliverable but rather a confirmaton that you have completed the first checkpoint and can feel more comfortable moving forward. Please bring your car to class if you wish you get the checkpoint rechecked.


# Summary

In summary, for this week you need to:

1. **P**: Negative voltage working

2. **P**: 4-bit ADC design

3. **P**: PCB Schematic.

4. Update your User Manual and Technical Documentation with your findings.
